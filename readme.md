# Skill Extraction: benchmarks

This is the official repository containing three skill extraction datasets, from the following papers:

1. [Design of Negative Sampling Strategies for Distantly Supervised Skill Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05987)
2. [Extreme Multi-Label Skill Extraction Training using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10778)

## Dataset description

The `TECH` and `HOUSE` subsets form an extention of the SkillSpan [[1]](#1) dataset, in which spans of skill mentions in sentences have been labeled with corresponding ESCO [[2]](#2) skills.

The `TECHWOLF` subset, although smaller, represents a more generic distribution of job descriptions and skill spans. ESCO skills are directly annotated on the full sentence level, thus omitting the intermediate span identification step.

The ESCO skills in the dataset are referenced by their preferred label, in the 1.1.0 ESCO version.

| Dataset statistics  | TECH      |           | HOUSE     |           | TECHWOLF  |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|                               | val       | test      | val       | test      | test      |
| # sentences                   | 470       | 1882      | 243       | 973       | 326       |
| # spans                       | 262       | 1024      | 191       | 786       | 588       |
| # spans with ESCO label       | 152       | 644       | 131       | 532       | 588       |

## Usage

It is recommended to use the HuggingFace datasets for ease of use:
- [TECH](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jensjorisdecorte/skill-extraction-tech)
- [HOUSE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jensjorisdecorte/skill-extraction-house)
- [TECHWOLF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jensjorisdecorte/skill-extraction-techwolf)

However, the raw dataset files are also kept under the [data](data) directory.
